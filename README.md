# MTG Noob Glossary

This is a free to use glossary for my latest obsession Magic: The Gathering.

This glossary intended to be used by new players to have quick and easy access to all turn rules, keyword descriptions, symbol meanings.

At the moment this will only be a basic app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript deployed via Github Pages but I might rebuild it into a more robust app in the future.

Feel free to contribute to this project or fork it to make your own.
