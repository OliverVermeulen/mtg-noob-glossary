# MTG Noob Glossary

This is a free to use glossary for my latest obsession Magic: The Gathering.

This is a glossary intended to be used by new players to have quick and easy access to all keyword descriptions, symbol meanings and round rules.

At the moment this will only be a basic app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript deployed via Github Pages but I might rebuild it into a more robust app in the future.

Feel free to contribute to this project or fork it to make your own.
